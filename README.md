Curate Analytics Rails Backend
------------------------------

This is a really brief readme about what will need to happen for this to work. I'll build this out as I go along. 

* Create User Auth with Email/Password
* User is pending until email is verified
* Setup up Mail Chimp account for Curate
* Databases:
  -Users with emails and password
  -Wardrobes with email id and images
